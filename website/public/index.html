    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoy doing software; that involves understanding the requirements,
      implementing the best solution, watch it work, and iterate on it.
      I probably won't be able to find the fastest route from A to B, but I
      will get you to B no matter what: error handling, avoiding deadlocks,
      and always having a plan B is my style.
    </p>

    <h3>Career path</h3>
    <p>
      As a teenager I started modding a game called <a href="https://www.terraria.org/">Terraria</a>
      and that made me fell in love with code and software. After HighSchool finshed I headed
      to study Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.unlam.edu.ar">Universidad de La Matanza</a>
      but three years later I realized that it was only slowing me down since I
      had no time left to work in the projects I wanted and thus dragging my motivation
      down making me no productive at all. I'm now mostly self-taught and I constantly
      learn new things at my job, online discussions and courses, and reading books and articles.
    </p>

    <h3>I'm good at</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Testing</dt>
      <dd>
        A feature is not done without its tests: true and false positives and
        negatives must be tested.
      </dd>

      <dt>Documentation</dt>
      <dd>
        No project I participate in comes without documentation.
      </dd>

      <dt>Clean Code</dt>
      <dd>
        I write code that is easy to understand and easy to modify, I call it
        self documented.
      </dd>

      <dt>Sharing Knowledge</dt>
      <dd>
        I often get told that I'm good at simplifying concepts and explaining
        them, I never seen it that way but after hearing it repeatedly it must
        be true.
      </dd>

      <dt>Questioning Everything</dt>
      <dd>
        What are the limitations of this implementation? Is this a priority?
        Will we finish that on time? How can we prevent this in the future?
        Is it our responsability to decide that?
      </dd>

      <dt>Linux</dt>
      <dd>
        I daily drive it and I use Arch btw
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>I'm average at</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Programming languages</dt>
      <dd>
        Jack of all trades, master of none. I avoid obscure features or micro
        optimization to make my code as readable as possible to everyone.
      </dd>

      <dt>SRE</dt>
      <dd>
        Dashboards and alerts go brrrrrr.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>I'm bad at</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Databases</dt>
      <dd>
        I can barely write select statements with the help of the internet, you
        don't want me as a DBA.
      </dd>

      <dt>Algorithms</dt>
      <dd>
        I struggle with easy problems in Leetcode and can barely solve medium.
      </dd>

      <dt>Memes</dt>
      <dd>
        I like memeing sometimes, but nobody laughs at them.
