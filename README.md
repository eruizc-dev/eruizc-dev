# Super neovim configuration

### To improve:

 - Launch programs within vim
 - Run tests within vim
 - Create/Delete files within vim
    - Automatic snippets for file creation (like java, automagically add package
      and class information.
    - Netrw navigation too slow...
    - Nerdtree navigation better but file creation sucks having to open menu
 - Telescope result window is too big, preview window too small

### Features I should try
