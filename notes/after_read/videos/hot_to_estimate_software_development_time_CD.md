 - It's hard to estimate

### Perfect plans are perfect stupid ideas

What you need to make a perfect plan:
 - Understand the Goal (a goal that may change)
 - Know all the steps (steps that may be missed)
 - Know how long each step wil take (hundreds of unknown things)
 - Predict all interruptions and miss-steps (impossible)

**Estimate** is only a facny word for **Guess**

### Precission vs Accuracy

pi = 17.630213  is more **precise**

pi = 3          is more **accurate**

The more details you analize the more precise you will be but less accurate you
will be

### Tips for estimation

 - Use the time of past tasks!
 - Compare with old work
 - Identify similar complecity
 - Limit the ilussion of precision:
    - Use simple nomenclatures. Small (S), Medium (M) or Large (L). If it goes
      into Extra Large, split the task. Large features should take no more than
      a week.
    - Throw estimates: everyone thinks of an estimate and reveals it at the same
      time, then you average (prefering higher values). If big differences you
      start a discussion because the task isn't clear.

### Avoid estimations
Best to avoid estimations and work as efficiently as possible, doing small releases
 - Requires trust from peope who pay the bills
 - People who work needs to be focused on what is more important
