It's mainly for students so the ambient is for college. But still works in other
situations.

### 4. Leader of the technical reading group

Roles:
 - Find material: ask for sugestions and feedback (keeps people engaged)
 - Facilitate discussions: everyone must leave understanding the main ideas
 - Make it happen: delegate, everyone should contribute

### 5. Finding technical papers

How:
 - Ask experienced people
 - Find patents
 - Academic Search Engines
 - Find more of an author you like
 - Search citations of a paper you like
 - Keep a personal library

What:
 - Make sure it fits everyone
 - 8 to 40 pages. Otherwise find important sections
 - Might be a bad choice if you didn't understand it

### 6. Facilitating Discussion

 - Be familiar with the papers
 - At the start of the meeting, ask/make/force everyone to ask 2 questions
   (including yourself), prevent people from answering and use these questions
   to guide the discussion
 - Make clear: no need to understand but you gotta have questions
 - Stop wandering discussions that gain no progress
 - Check the clock, but allow further discussion
 - Noone should dominate the discussion
 - Promote questions
 - Maintain lexical order from the beginning to the end of the reading
 - Silence means next question
 - Browse reference papers, invite people
 - Last question: what the group thought of the paper

### 7. Feedback

 - Wind down oportunity
 - Look for improvements

### 8. Limitations

 - Lack of direction: set a goal
 - Participation issues: start with a low technical paper and provide aditional
   readings for people to catch up
