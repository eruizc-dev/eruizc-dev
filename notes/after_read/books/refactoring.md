Design Stamina Hypothesis [mf-dsh]:
 - By putting our effor t into a good internal design, we increase the stamina of
  the software effort, allowing us to go faster for longer.

Branch by Abstraction [mf-bba]:
 - When you need to make a big change, separate it into small steps everyone
   does whenever they happen to be close to that code. In the long term, the
   change will be effective.
