I love this window manager, and the fact that it's configurable with lua makes
things easier for me (same as Neovim)

### Other configurations to steal from

### TODO:

 - Because of my keyboard switching to pain panel (Super + Fn + q) is very
   similar to closing active window (Super + q) so I end up closing 2-3 windows
   per day by accident. Pls fix.
 - Vertical stack for my secondary (vertical) screen would be awesome
